Moreover, the introduction of multiple subgenotypes and the emergence of recombinant viruses is of epidemiological importance. Based on either the full genome or VP1 sequences, 32 enteroviruses (30 from HFMD patients, 1 from an encephalitic patient, and 1 from an asymptomatic contact case) isolated in Thailand between 2006 and 2014 were identified as 25 enterovirus 71 (EV71) isolates (comprising 20 B5, 1 C2, 2 C4a, and 2 C4b subgenotypes) and 7 coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) isolates (comprising 6 B1a and 1 B1b subgenotypes). The EV71 subgenotype C4b was introduced into Thailand for the first time in 2006 and was replaced by subgenotype C4a strains in 2009. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses of the complete viral genomes identified 12 recombinant viruses among the 32 viral isolates. Only one EV71-B5 isolate out of 20 was a recombinant virus with one region of intratypic or intertypic recombination, while all four EV71-C4 isolates were recombinant viruses having undergone double recombination, and all seven CA16 isolates were recombinant viruses. The recombination breakpoints of these recombinants are located solely within the P2 and P3 regions. Surveillance for circulating strains and subgenotype replacement are important with respect to molecular epidemiology and the selection of the upcoming EV71 vaccine. In addition, the clinical importance of recombinant viruses needs to be further explored.","possitive"

Alignment and comparison of 1485 nucleotides of the S and M genomic segments enzymatically amplified from these tissues indicated that these deer mice harbored a hantavirus which was genetically similar, differing by less than 2% at the deduced amino-acid level, to the hantavirus implicated in cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurring in the Four-Corners region of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado in 1993. The peromyscine rodent-borne hantaviruses were, in turn, genetically distinct from other well-characterized hantaviruses, diverging by approximately 30% from Prospect Hill and Puumala viruses at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Phylogenetic analysis using the maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, and unweighted pair-group methods indicated that the Peromyscus-derived hantavirus shared a common ancestry with arvicolid rodent-borne hantaviruses. Overall congruency of the phylogenetic trees based on the S and M genomic sequences supported the evolutionary position of the peromyscine rodent-borne hantaviruses. Our data also establish the existence of a hantavirus enzootic in deer mice long before the recognition of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States.","possitive"

The variant, 1088-N30, was well adapted to NA cells and highly attenuated in adult mice after intramuscular (i.m.) but not intracerebral (i.c.) inoculations. 1088-N30 had seven nucleotide substitutions, and the R196S mutation of the G protein led to an additional N-glycosylation. Street viruses usually possess one or two N-glycosylation sites on the G protein, 1088 has two, while an additional N-glycosylation site is observed in laboratory-adapted strains. We also established a cloned variant 1088-N4#14 by limiting dilution. Apart from the R196S mutation, 1088-N4#14 possessed only one amino acid substitution in the P protein, which is found in several field isolates. 1088-N4#14 also efficiently replicated in NA cells and was attenuated in adult mice after i.m. inoculations, although it was more pathogenic than 1088-N30. The spread of 1088-N30 in the brain was highly restricted after i.m. inoculations, although the pattern of 1088-N4#14's spread was intermediate between that of the parental 1088 and 1088-N30. Meanwhile, both variants strongly induced humoral immune responses in mice compared to 1088. Our results indicate that the additional N-glycosylation is likely related to the reduced pathogenicity. Taken together, we propose that the number of N-glycosylation sites in the G protein is one of the determinants of the pathogenicity of street rabies viruses.","possitive"

Amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of part of the genome encoding a region of the RNA polymerase (L gene) confirmed that the virus was a member of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, but that it did not partition with any of the currently recognised paramyxovirus genera and instead segregated with the unclassified rodent viruses, J-virus, Beilong virus and Tailam virus as well as paramyxoviruses recently detected in rodents in Africa. A subsequent examination of kidney samples from red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) revealed that they too harboured a paramyxovirus, but sequence analysis of the corresponding region of the L gene revealed that it was approximately 67% identical to the grey squirrel virus, suggesting the presence of a second species of virus. In addition, one of the red squirrels examined harboured a second virus with approximately 69% identity to the grey squirrel virus, but only approximately 63% identity to the other red squirrel viruses, signifying the presence of a third species of paramyxovirus.

"337","10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.023","Genomic and phylogenetic analyses of murine adenovirus 2","Murine adenoviruses (MAdV) are supposedly the oldest members of the genus Mastadenovirus. Currently, there are three distinct MAdV types known with rather different tropism and pathology. Here we report and annotate the DNA sequence of the full genome of MAdV-2. It was found to consist of 35,203 bp thus being considerably larger than the genomes of the other two MAdV types. The increased size of the MAdV-2 genome is generally due to larger genes and ORFs, although some differences in the number of ORFs were observed for the early regions E1, E3 and E4. The homologue of the 19K gene of E1B from MAdV-2 codes for 330 amino acids (aa) and is almost twice as large as from other mastadenoviruses. Accordingly, only the N-terminal half (155aa) has homology to the 19K protein. A homologue of the gene of the 12.5K protein was identified in the E3 region of MAdV-2, but not in MAdV-1 or MAdV-3. The other gene of yet unknown function in the E3 region of MAdV-2 seems to be unique. The E4 region of MAdV-2 contains three ORFs. One has similarity to the 34K gene of other AdVs. Two unique ORFs in the E4 region of MAdV-2 have no homology to any of the five and six ORFs in the E4 region of MAdV-1 or MAdV-3, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the three murine AdVs have a close common ancestor. They likely formed the first branching of the lineage of mastadenoviruses, and seem to be the most ancient representatives of this genus.","possitive"

Found primarily in mountainous areas, the Korean field mouse (A. peninsulae) is the second-most dominant field rodent species found throughout Korea. A new hantavirus, designated Soochong (SOO), was isolated in Vero E6 cells from four A. peninsulae captured in August 1997 at Mt. Gyebang in Hongcheon-gun, Mt. Gachil, Inje-gun, Gangwon Province, and in September 1998 at Mt. Deogyu, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk Province. The entire S, M, and L genomic segments of SOO virus, amplified by RT-PCR from lung tissues of seropositive A. peninsulae and from virus-infected Vero E6 cells, diverged from HTN virus (strain 76-118) by 15.6%, 22.8%, and 21.7% at the nucleotide level and 3.5%, 9.5%, and 4.6% at the amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, using the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, indicated that SOO virus was distinct from A. agrarius-borne HTN virus. SOO virus shared a common ancestry with Amur virus from Far East Russia, as well as with H5 and B78 hantaviruses, previously isolated from HFRS patients in China. Cross-focus-reduction neutralizating antibody tests showed that SOO virus, which is the first hantavirus isolated in cell culture from A. peninsulae, could be classified as a new hantavirus serotype.","possitive"

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology to define genomic sequences of the viruses. Of particular interest is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to perform phylogeographic analysis, that allows the detection and tracking of the emergence of viral infections. Hantaviruses, Bunyaviridae, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans. We propose to use WGS for the phylogeographic analysis of human hantavirus infections. A novel multiplex PCR-based NGS was developed to gather whole genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from HFRS patients and rodent hosts in endemic areas. The obtained genomes were described for the spatial and temporal links between cases and their sources. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated geographic clustering of HTNV strains from clinical specimens with the HTNV strains circulating in rodents, suggesting the most likely site and time of infection. Recombination analysis demonstrated a genome organization compatible with recombination of the HTNV S segment. The multiplex PCR-based NGS is useful and robust to acquire viral genomic sequences and may provide important ways to define the phylogeographical association and molecular evolution of hantaviruses.","possitive"

We investigated seroprevalence to selected groups of rodent-borne viruses among human populations with high levels of animal exposure and among co-located rodent populations. The indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was used to determine seropositivity to representative reference strains of hantaviruses (Dobrava virus [DOBV], Seoul virus [SEOV]), cowpox virus, arenaviruses (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]), flaviviruses (tick-borne encephalitis virus [TBEV]), and rodent parechoviruses (Ljungan virus), using sera from 245 humans living in Dong Thap Province and 275 rodents representing the five common rodent species sold in wet markets and present in peridomestic and farm settings. Combined seropositivity to DOBV and SEOV among the rodents and humans was 6.9% (19/275) and 3.7% (9/245), respectively; 1.1% (3/275) and 4.5% (11/245) to cowpox virus; 5.4% (15/275) and 47.3% (116/245) for TBEV; and exposure to Ljungan virus was 18.8% (46/245) in humans, but 0% in rodents. Very little seroreactivity was observed to LCMV in either rodents (1/275, 0.4%) or humans (2/245, 0.8%). Molecular screening of rodent liver tissues using consensus primers for flaviviruses did not yield any amplicons, whereas molecular screening of rodent lung tissues for hantavirus yielded one hantavirus sequence (SEOV). In summary, these results indicate low to moderate levels of endemic hantavirus circulation, possible circulation of a flavivirus in rodent reservoirs, and the first available data on human exposures to parechoviruses in Vietnam. Although the current evidence suggests only limited exposure of humans to known rodent-borne diseases, further research is warranted to assess public health implications of the rodent trade.","possitive"

Blood and tissue samples were collected from 507 rodents during seven field trips from March 2004 to April 2006. Some of the animals were karyotyped to confirm morphological identification. Phylogenetic reconstructions of rodent specimens, based on the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene sequences, were also obtained. Hantavirus antibody was found in 22 (4.3%) of the 507 rodents: 5 Akodon montensis, 2 Akodon paranaensis, 14 Oligoryzomys nigripes, and 1 Sooretamys angouya. Viral RNAs detected in O. nigripes and A. montensis were amplified and sequenced. O. nigripes virus genome was 97.5% (nt) and 98.4% (nt) identical to sequences published for Araucaria (Juquitiba-like) virus based on N and G2 fragment sequences. Viral sequences from A. montensis strain showed 89% and 88% nucleotide identities in a 905-nt fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) protein-coding region of the S segment when it was compared with two other Akodontine rodent-associated viruses from Paraguay, A. montensis and Akodon cursor, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed the cocirculation of two genetic hantavirus lineages in the state of Santa Catarina, one from O. nigripes and the other from A. montensis, previously characterized in Brazil and Paraguay, respectively. The hantavirus associated with A. montensis, designed JaborÃ¡ virus, represents a distinct phylogenetic lineage among the Brazilian hantaviruses.","possitive"

However, like the large non-structural protein NS1 of the human parvovirus B19, the ChpPV NS1 is a potent inducer of apoptosis. Further phylogenetic analysis of ChpPV with other parvoviruses in the subfamily Parvovirinae indicates that ChpPV is distinct from the members in genus Erythrovirus.

"458","10.1006/viro.1995.0071","Naturally Occurring Sin Nombre Virus Genetic Reassortants","Genetic reassortment has been shown to play an important role in the evolution of several segmented RNA viruses and in the epidemiology of associated diseases. Sin Nombre (SN) virus is the cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome throughout the western United States. Like other hantaviruses, it possesses a genome consisting of three negative-sense RNA segments, S, M, and L. Recent analysis has demonstrated the presence of at least three different hantaviruses in Nevada and eastern California, including SN, Prospect Hill-like, and El Moro Canyon-like viruses. In addition, two distinct lineages of SN virus can be found in Peromyscus maniculatus rodents (sometimes in close proximity) trapped at study sites in this region. Data obtained by phylogenetic analysis of sequence differences detected among the S, M, and L genome segments of these SN viruses are consistent with reassortment having taken place between SN virus genetic variants. The results suggest that M (and to a lesser extent S or L) genome segment flow occurs within SN virus populations in P. maniculatus in this region. No reassortment was detected between SN virus and other hantavirus types present in the area. This finding suggests that as genetic distance increases, the frequency of formation of viable reassortants decreases, or that hantaviruses which are primarily maintained in different rodent hosts rarely have the opportunity to genetically interact.","possitive"

However, the etiology of 10-20% hepatitis cases remains unclear. Some hepatitis-associated viruses, like the hepatitis E virus, are zoonotic pathogens. Rats, shrews, and bats are reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, understanding the virome in the liver of these animals is important for the investigation of the etiologies of hepatitis and monitoring the emerging zoonotic viruses. In this study, viral metagenomics and PCR methods were used to investigate viral communities in rats, mice, house shrews, and bats livers. Viral metagenomic analysis showed a diverse set of sequences in liver samples, comprising: sequences related to herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, anelloviruses, hepeviruses, hepadnaviruses, flaviviruses, parvoviruses, and picornaviruses. Using PCR methods, we first detected hepatovirus sequences in  Hipposideros larvatus  (3.85%). We also reported the first detection of Zika virus-related sequences in rats and house shrews. Sequences related to influenza A virus and herpesviruses were detected in liver. Higher detection rates of pegivirus sequences were found in liver tissue and serum samples from rats (7.85% and 15.79%, respectively) than from house shrews. Torque teno virus sequences had higher detection rates in the serum samples of rats and house shrews (52.72% and 5.26%, respectively) than in the liver. Near-full length genomes of pegivirus and torque teno virus were amplified. This study is the first to compare the viral communities in the liver of bats, rats, mice, and house shrews. Its findings expand our understanding of the virome in the liver of these animals and provide an insight into hepatitis-related viruses.","possitive"

IgG antibodies against hantavirus were also identified in laboratory rats, which were used by these students for their scientific research. Phylogenetic analysis showed that partial small segment sequences recovered from humans, laboratory rats, and local wild rats belonged to SEOV. Hantavirus sequences recovered from humans and laboratory rats clustered within 1 of 3 lineages of SEOV circulating among local wild rats in Shenyang. These results suggest that the HFRS outbreak in Shenyang was caused by SEOV that was circulating among local wild rats and had also infected the laboratory rats.","possitive"

They are small, non-enveloped viruses with bisegmented, double-stranded (ds) RNA genomes. Although they are found in the feces of a broad range of hosts, information regarding their genomes is limited to viruses detected from humans, rabbits, and porcine. Identification of PBVs has been done using PAGE and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). In this study, we present a phylogenetic analysis of PBVs detected in the feces of dogs, snakes, and rats. In addition, we compare these strains to those from human and porcine hosts. To do so, 487 fecal specimens from dogs, snakes and rats were analyzed by PAGE. The positive specimens for PBV were tested by RT-PCR using primers for genogroup I of the PBVs. From the 11 genogroup I PBV samples, at least one from each host was sequenced and submitted for phylogenetic analysis. All of the sequences showed high homology with the human and porcine genogroup I PBV sequences. In this study we report the first detection of PBVs in snakes (8.5%). We also report a phylogenetic analysis that goes beyond humans and pigs to include dogs, rats, and snakes. However, more hosts must be included in the analysis so that we may reach better conclusions regarding the spread of these viruses.","possitive"
